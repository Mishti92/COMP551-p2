Assignment 2, COMP 551 - Applied Machine Learning 
Text Classification

FOR PART1:

To run Naive Bayes, run naivebayes.py
It will call datasplit.py. 

For output1,2,3 files after cross validation - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1y42dcrN1bLZGktbDBTN0QxTGc 

Data should be in ../data.

FOR PART2:

This folders contains two scripts:  dsc1.ipynb and knn.ipynb. dsc1 is the implemented domain specific classifier and knn is the implemented k nearest neighbours classifier. To run the script, please open an ipython notebook IDE and run the code block by block. 

When you run the scripts, make sure the files X_train.csv, X_test.csv, and Y_train.csv (From url - https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1y42dcrN1bLZGktbDBTN0QxTGc) are in the same folder as the scripts. These three datasets are processed after data cleaning as described in the paper.

FOR PART3:

Open the optional.pynb file and run the code clock by block. Make sure the original data files (train input and output and test input) are in a level above this in /data folder.
